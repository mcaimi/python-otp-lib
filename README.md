-= OTP Token Generation Library, 100% Pyre Python =-

This library implements functions that generate OTP Tokens based on RFC4226 (HOTP)
and RFC 6238 (TOTP).

Additionally, the library implements a custom version of HMAC-SHA-1 that serves
as a base for the mentioned algorithms (RFC 2104).

HOW TO USE THIS LIBRARY:

1- HMAC
The implementation default settings lets you compute HMAC-SHA-1 auth codes.
returned codes are byte strings, so you need to convert them to something else if 
needed:

for example, if key="ORSXG5A=" and message=1234 (string and integer respectively),
you need to only pack the message in a byte-like object:

#!/usr/bin/env python
import struct
from rfc2104 import hmac

key="ORSXG5A="
msg=1234

hmac = hmac.HMAC(key, struct.pack(">Q", msg))
print(hmac)

the result is:
==> b'A3\x91v\xa5\xf7\xb0\xe5#\xb1\xa3\xa0a\xdf&\x13JC\x8ai'

2- HOTP
The default implementation uses SHA-1 as the HMAC digest and an 8 byte unsigned integer
as HOTP counter.
Internal conversions are automatically performed by the code.

#!/usr/bin/env python
from rfc4226 import hotp

key = "ORSXG5A="
msg = 1234

hotp = hotp.HOTP(key, msg)
print(hotp)

the result is:
==> 807009

3- TOTP
TOTP is a special case of HOTP in which the counter is a 64bit unsigned timestamp
The Google Authenticator implementation deviates from the RFC, because it expects the key
to be encoded in base32.

#!/usr/bin/env python
from rfc6238 import totp
import base64

key = "ORSXG5A="
msg = 1234

totp = totp.TOTP(key)
print(totp)

google_key = base64.b32decode(key)
google_totp = totp.TOTP(google_key)

print(totp)
print(google_totp)

the result is:
==> 426337
==> 234866
